Finished up the project. I had some issues with it when I "stopped" working on it last week on 5/17, but I was quickly able to resolve them today. Fixing things the first try and being pretty confident it's the issue is a great feeling and a tell-tale sign that I'm becoming a better programmer. I feel that my engineering degree has helped me immensely in regards to training my brain how to think this way, but as a professional I haven't used it much in years so it's been really nice to get that feeling of intuition back when doing these projects. I noted it during the comments over the entire commented out section of javascript that I am 99% sure that I did this project wrong, but it still works. I know, after reading the exercise tips on theodinproject.com, and watching a video by Web Dev Simplified, that I should have instead written everything as a function, and when clicked, or whatever the event needs to be, all of the different functions run, or are nested within one another. This was an error on my part and while I'm glad the project works, I'm upset that I went the complete incorrect route. I'm still very proud and will continue to write programs for practice, but I will be much more mindful about using functions and things that can be "reused" by different events or callbacks. 

All-in-all, I loved this project. It was a lot of fun and tested a lot of my knowledge and I felt like I came out of it a lot more confident of a programmer and excited to start practicing more off-site DOM manipulation projects.
